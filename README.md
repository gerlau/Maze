1. How to color border? 
2. How to split?
- What if split vertically and it's next to L/R?
- What if split horizontally and it's next to T/B?
- What if cell at TR/TL/BR/BL? 
- What if a square appeared? 
Ans: Odd separation. Vertically or Horizontally.
- What if split at a cell spacing?
- What if whole column/row is "1"? That means no split occured?
- What if single column/row?

Things to note:
- grid must be odd length & breadth

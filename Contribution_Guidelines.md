*Disclaimer The following work was inspired byfirstcontributions.github.io to understand and learn better how markdown works.

## 1. Fork this repository on GitHub

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. 
Once you have forked a repo, you own your forked copy. This means that you can edit the contents of your forked repository without impacting the parent repo.

## 2. Clone the repository to your local machine

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, *click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon*.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:
```
git clone "web_url"
```
where "web_url" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). 

**For example:**
```
git clone "https://github.com/gerlau/Maze.git"
```
Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

# 4. Add a remote origin 
Open a terminal and run the following git command:
```
git remote add origin "web_url"
```
The git remote command is one piece of the broader system which is responsible for syncing changes.

# 4. Create a branch 
4.1 Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):
```
cd "the repository_name"/
```
4.2 Now create a branch using the following git command:
```
git checkout -b new-branch
```

# 5. Make the necessary changes and commit those changes to your current branch    
:bulb: Tips: `git status` to view the changes | `git branch` to check which branch you are on.

5.1 Add those changes to the branch you just created by executing the following git command:
```
git add .
```

Note: `git add .` tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit. 

5.2 Commit those changes by executing the following git command:
```
git commit -m "Create README.md" -m "Some desc"
```

# 6. Push changes to GitHub
6.1 Push your changes by executing the following git command:
```
git push -u origin branch
```

# 6. Submit your changes for review
6.1 If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.  
6.2 Now submit the pull request by clicking `Create pull request` button.   
6.3 If all conversation are resolved then click `Merge pull request` and `Confirm Merge` buttons.    
6.4 Once merged, update your local machine repo  
```
git checkout master  
git pull
```

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
